Scenario Outline: Verify Filter Arrowing - T1 "Narrow by Brand", T2 "Narrow by Product Type"

  Given I am on POS simulator page
  When I search for the "sns_active_T1_T2_T3_keywords"
	And I click on "<Tkey>"
  Then I should see list of filters listed
	 And I should see first one as "<FilterHeader>" with "Red" outline and "yellow" background
  When I press the "down" arrow key "1" time
  Then I should see second filter selected with "red" outline and "yellow" background
  When I press the "up" arrow key "1" time
  Then I should move one level up with "Red" outline and "Yellow" background
  	 
  Examples:
	|Tkey                         |FilterHeader     |
	|T1 Narrow By Brand           |All Brands       |
	|T2 Narrow by Product Type    |All Product Types|
